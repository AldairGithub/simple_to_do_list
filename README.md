## To Do List

I wanted to practice and use common features such as local storage.
I also wanted to use more animations on exits and entrances, using framer-motion allows me to do so. 

## Highlights

It was tricky to get a working exit animation on displaying inputs or changing tasks, but framer-motion is very versatile when it comes to React deletion of DOM objects.
